            <h2>Life, Loss, and What We Learn</h2>
            <p>Life has a way of hitting you in places you didn’t even know could hurt. Sometimes, it’s not about what you could’ve done differently, but about the things you witnessed and can never unsee. There are moments that leave a scar so deep, it feels like it will never heal. For me, those moments are tied to the people and the souls I’ve lost—friends and pets that meant the world to me.</p>

            <p>I had three friends, three amazing people who, for reasons I’ll never fully understand, decided to end their lives. And the worst part? I was there, watching it all unfold over a video call. At first, I didn’t realize what was happening. When I finally understood, I froze. <span class="highlight">If I had reacted sooner, maybe I could have stopped them.</span> My body went numb, and my mind couldn’t process what I was seeing. <span class="highlight">I should have said something, screamed, or done anything to help them.</span></p>

            <p><span class="highlight">If I could go back in time, I would say everything I had in my heart.</span> I would tell them that they mattered, that life, no matter how painful, is worth living. These thoughts haunt me because I know I can’t change the past.</p>

            <p>As if that wasn’t enough, I lost two of my best companions not long after. My dogs, Canelo and Canela, were more than just pets—they were family. <span class="highlight">If I had spent more time with them, maybe I wouldn’t feel so much regret now.</span> Canelo was the protector, always by my side as if he knew when I needed him most. Canela, on the other hand, had this playful energy that could brighten even the darkest days.</p>

            <p>When Canela passed away, it was like the house lost its warmth. Her little routines, like waiting by the door for me or nudging me when I was sad, all of that was gone. <span class="highlight">I should have cherished those moments more.</span> And then, not long after, I had to say goodbye to Canelo. He held on for as long as he could, but his time came too. I remember sitting with him in his final moments, stroking his fur, whispering to him how much I loved him. It broke me in ways I didn’t think were possible.</p>

            <p>Now, I carry all of this with me—those moments I couldn’t change, the losses I couldn’t stop. Some nights, I lie awake wondering <span class="highlight">what would happen if things had been different.</span> <span class="highlight">If I had made different choices, would I feel less guilt?</span> <span class="highlight">If you tell the people you love how much they mean to you, they will know how much you care.</span> If you spend every possible moment with them, you won’t live with as many regrets. Life is fleeting, but the love we share can last forever.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Have you ever felt this kind of loss? How do you move forward when the past keeps pulling you back?</p>
