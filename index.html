            <div class="content">
                <p>Life has a way of hitting you in places you didn’t even know could hurt. Sometimes, it’s not about what you *should have done* but about accepting what you couldn’t control. I think about my three friends who are no longer here and wonder, "Should I have noticed the signs earlier? Could I have said something to stop them?" The truth is, I couldn’t change what happened, but the guilt remains.</p>

            <p>As if losing my friends wasn’t hard enough, I also had to say goodbye to my dogs, Canelo and Canela. I often think, "I should have spent more time with them. I should have played with Canela more when she was so energetic." Those small regrets pile up, making grief even harder to bear.</p>

            <p>The thing about grief is that it doesn’t follow logic. Even when you know deep down that you couldn’t have changed the outcome, your heart whispers, "I should have been there sooner." Over time, though, I’ve realized that it’s not about what I *should have done*; it’s about cherishing the memories I have and holding onto the love we shared.</p>

            <p>Writing has helped me process the pain. It allows me to reflect and find clarity in moments clouded by sorrow. If I could give advice to someone feeling this way, I’d say, "You shouldn’t blame yourself for what was out of your control. Instead, focus on the beautiful moments you had." That’s the lesson loss has taught me: to let go of the "should haves" and embrace the memories with gratitude.</p>

            <p>In the end, loss reminds us of how precious life is. It urges us to love fiercely and forgive freely. If you’ve experienced loss, know that healing doesn’t mean forgetting. It means learning to carry your grief with strength and finding peace in the memories of what you once had.</p>

            <p class="highlight">What are your "should haves"? How do you find peace in moments when life feels too heavy?</p>
