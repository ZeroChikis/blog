            <h2>Life, Loss, and What We Learn</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Life has a way of hitting you in places you didn’t even know could hurt. Sometimes, it’s not about what you could’ve done differently but about the things you witnessed and can never unsee. There are moments that leave a scar so deep, it feels like it will never heal. For me, those moments are tied to the people and the souls I’ve lost—friends and pets that meant the world to me.</p>

                <p>I had three friends, three amazing people who, for reasons I’ll never fully understand, decided to end their lives. And the worst part? I was there, watching it all unfold over a video call. At first, I didn’t realize what was happening. When I finally understood, I froze. My body went numb, and my mind couldn’t process what I was seeing. I sat there, staring at the screen, unable to say or do anything. I wanted to scream, to plead, to stop them, but no words came out. It felt like time stood still, and all I could do was watch helplessly as everything fell apart. To this day, I don’t know how to describe that kind of pain—the shock, the disbelief, the guilt that comes after.</p>

                <img src="img/descarga.jpg" alt="Image 1">

                <p>As if that wasn’t enough, I lost two of my best companions not long after. My dogs, Canelo and Canela, who were more than just pets—they were family. They were my comfort, my safe space when life became too much. Canelo was the protector, always by my side, as if he knew when I needed him most. Canela, on the other hand, had this playful energy that could brighten even the darkest days. Losing them felt like losing a part of myself.</p>

                <p>When Canela passed away, it was like the house lost its warmth. Her little routines, the way she’d wait by the door for me, or how she’d nudge me when I was sad, all of that was gone. And then, not long after, I had to say goodbye to Canelo. He held on for as long as he could, but his time came too. I remember sitting with him in his final moments, stroking his fur, whispering to him how much I loved him. It broke me in ways I didn’t think were possible.</p>

                <img src="img/canela.jpeg" alt="Canela">

                <p>Now, I carry all of this with me—those moments I couldn’t change, the losses I couldn’t stop. Some nights, I lie awake wondering what I could’ve done differently. Could I have said something to my friends to make them stay? Could I have spent more time with Canelo and Canela, given them more of the love they gave me so effortlessly? These questions haunt me, but I know the answers won’t change what’s already happened.</p>

                <img src="img/descarga (1).jpg" alt="Image 2">

                <p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned through all this, it’s that time is never guaranteed. Tell the people you love how much they mean to you. Spend every possible moment with those who make life worth living, human or not. Because when they’re gone, all you’ll have left are the memories—and the hope that somehow, somewhere, they knew how much you cared.</p>

                <p class="highlight">Have you ever felt this kind of loss? How do you move forward when the past keeps pulling you back?</p>
